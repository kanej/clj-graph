TODOs
=====

- [*] Look again at signatures of depth and breadth first search
- [*] Move the algorithms and protocols into their own folder
- [*] Rename the Edge Matrix protocol
- [*] Tests around the Vertex Queue protocol stuff
- [ ] Look again at the FIFO/FILO tests, enqueue of multiple values not covered, needs better BFS and DFS tests as well. 
- [ ] Adjacency List implementation of graph
- [ ] Support directed graphs
- [ ] Better forms of graph initialisation, one vertex or edge at a time, really?
